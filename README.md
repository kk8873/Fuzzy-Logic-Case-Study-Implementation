Fuzzy Logic-Based Controller for Steam Engine Turbines

This repository contains the implementation and results of a fuzzy logic-based controller (FLC) designed for throttle control in power-generating steam turbines. The project explores how fuzzy logic can address the challenges of non-linearity and uncertainties in turbine dynamics, outperforming conventional control methods.

Project Overview

Conventional control methods for steam engine turbines often struggle to maintain optimal performance due to the inherent non-linearity and uncertainties in turbine dynamics. This case study investigates the potential of fuzzy logic to enhance the control and performance of steam turbines, focusing on:

Problem Definition: Understanding the limitations of existing control approaches.
Fuzzy Logic Fundamentals: Introducing fuzzy logic concepts, membership functions, and fuzzy rules for decision-making.
FLC Design: Detailed architecture, input/output variables, and rule base.
System Integration: Incorporating the FLC into the steam turbine control system.

Key Features
Fuzzy Logic Controller Design:
Development of membership functions and fuzzy rules.
Input variables: Load demand, turbine speed.
Output variable: Throttle valve position.
